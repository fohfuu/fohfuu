#### Hello!

Thanks for being interested to have a look at my profile, haha

I'm not fluent in absolutely any language, and I don't even know most of the theory.
I'm just a humble home user who's doing her best

FOSS is the future, as the capitalism that usually accompanies closed-source projects
leads to bad user experiences, general bloat, and of course, a total lack of privacy.

As a disabled user, I greatly value accessibility - not just for myself, but for others too.
Personally, I use Text-To-Speak as I am intermittent semi-verbal (ie it's really difficult for me to speak at times).
I also try to reduce the amount of physical and mental effort I need to use;
I have a neurological disability called FND, which causes me varying levels of fatigue, pain, brain fog, etc.
Reducing this effort by streamlining software operations and alternative input options help when I have reduced mobility.
Additionally, I can get overloaded by light and sound. Tweaking these to reduce irritation is pretty damn important.

I can't offer much in terms of programming. I believe I am pretty good at providing feedback that is
constructive and detailed.

I'm currently focusing on doing as much as I can in bash. Absolutely not the best choice for most applications,
but I figured I might as well get comfortable using the terminal. I haven't needed to do a fresh install once!

...but I probably should

My other interests are anime, illustration (digital, with a little dip in design), mobile gaming, and learning in general.


There is no future without Indigenous land rights and BBA liberation. Trans rights. Disabled rights. Intersex rights. Luxury Gay Space Communism. etc.
